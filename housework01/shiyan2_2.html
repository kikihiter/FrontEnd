	<h1>More sunshine forecast, drought feared</h1>
	
	<p>by Ellen Deling</p>
	
	<p><strong>Meteorologists predict more sunshine and scorching temperatures for the upcoming week, prompting area farmers to install irrigation systems.</strong></p>

	<p>With little rain in the past month, the threat of drought looms for area farmers, with anticipated crop loses as high as $1 million, estimated George Granger, spokesman for the <em>NFA</em> (National Farm Association). We're all hoping it rains soon, some farmers have installed irrigation systems, at considerable expense, Granger said.</p>

	<p>Last Friday, <em>IrrigationDirect</em>, a supplier of irrigation equipment, offered farmers who were members of the <a href="">NFA</a> discounts in an effort to help eliviate the financial burden facing area farmers.</p>

	<p>While the sunshine will likely continue through the week, the good news, say area weather forecasters, is that the dome of hot air causing the high temperatures would eventually pass, allowing temperatures to return to normal.</p>
